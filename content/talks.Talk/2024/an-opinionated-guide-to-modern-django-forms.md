title: An Opinionated Guide to Modern Django Forms
description: |
  In my journey as a Django developer, I know the moment when I did not consider myself a
  beginner anymore: when I started leveraging Django custom model managers and querysets.
  Initially they can seem intimidating and potentially complex. However, they can help
  make your use of the ORM more efficient, allow you to encapsulate complex and repetitive
  queries, and provide an API surface area that makes it easier to introduce certain changes
  to Model fields and queries, among other benefits.
stinger: So long, and thanks for all the fish
