Josh Thomas is a Junior System Administrator living in Tuscaloosa, AL.

He works mainly within the Microsoft Windows environment, though he has been known to dabble in the GNU/FOSS world of Ubuntu and CentOS & in containers with Docker.

During his free time he enjoys cooking for his wife and playing with his 12-yr-old beagle [Buster](https://www.instagram.com/p/XTidm9jaMU/). He is currently obsessed with using his new sous vide wand to cook the perfect steak.
